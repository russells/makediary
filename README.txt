Make diary folder pages.

This is a set of python modules and a wrapper program that output
PostScript code for a year diary.  The diary can be on one of a range of
paper sizes, and can have a number of different types of front matter
pages.

This is licensed under the GNU General Public Licence, see the file
COPYING.

After the end of the 10th year after any release, the licence is dropped and
you can do what you want with it.  So that's the end of 2031 for version 0.4.1.

For a very special reason, this used to be called cdp.  :)
