Make diary folder pages.

This is a set of python modules and a wrapper program that output
PostScript code for a year diary.  The diary can be on one of a range of
paper sizes, and can have a number of different types of front matter
pages.

It's presented with a setup.py for python's distutils.  To make an
installable package, do:

  python setup.py bdist


For a very special reason, this used to be called cdp.  :)
